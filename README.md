## Number-Guesser Max & Kayla
The object of Number Guesser is for two people to work together and create a game that interacts with two players.

The game on-load populates a range from 1 - 100 and picks a random number between that range.

If the users choose to set their own range, they absolutely can. A new random number will be generated between the new range and also be displayed in the current range section. 

Moving further into the game you have challenger one and challenger two allowing your users to place their names and their guesses. You can reset the game and clear the game, these buttons are disabled until the interact with the game. There are four main buttons for the 1st part of the game.

The Update button allows the users to place their own range. The functionality within javascript communicates the new range within the elements of current range.

The Submit button allows for the players to keep guessing until one player gets the right answer. The latest score section will tell the users if their guess is too high or too low. When a player guesses the correct number the display will change to BOOM! indicating that player is the winner. When there is a winner a card to will then pop up in the leaderboard section. This card displays the names of each player, the winner of that round, how many guesses it took and the time it took the players to get to the correct number. 

Each card does display with the most recent win on top. You can individually delete the cards, if you would like or you can clear the whole leaderboard but clicking the Clear Leaderboard button, the fifth button in the game. 

The game is mobile friendly.
